# D&D Beyond Translate

Extension to translate your D&D Beyond character sheet page to your language.

It's also useful to use the International System of Units (SI) for the metrics of character, spells, monsters, etc.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using the character sheet in English is difficult, sometimes (Honestly, I didn't know what "Sleight of hand" meant, and I believe that "theft" or "steal" make more sense), so I've created this extension to simplify the process.

### Languages

Currently we have translations to Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish. These translations aren't complete, they just have the main content, such as skills and proficiencies (the content that is usually more difficult to read).

### Contributing

Feel free to add more translations to the existing languages.

To add a new language, just:

1. Add the translation file on the `translations` folder, following the JSON structure of the other files;
2. Add the path of the translation on `web_accessible_resources[0].resources`;
3. Add the language at the end of the HTML select list, on `popup/popup.html`, line 14 and the following ones.

### Thanks

If you liked the extension, please give us a star on Github and a good note on Google Chrome Web Store.
